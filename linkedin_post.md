🚀 **Just Shipped: My New AI-Powered Interview Coach!** 🤖🎤

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: a fully **Humanoid AI Interviewer** that simulates real job interviews with voice interaction!

💡 **What it does:**
This isn't just a text bot. The agent:
✅ ** Speaks to you** using natural, clear Neural vocals.
✅ **Listens to your answers** in real-time (no typing needed!).
✅ **Adapts to Your Language**: Whether you prefer **English**, **Spanish**, **French**, or **Hindi**, the AI instantly switches contexts and conducts the interview seamlessly in your native tongue.
✅ **Custom Tailored**: Upload your Resume/CV, and it generates specific questions based on your actual experience.

🛠️ **Under the Hood:**
*   **Tech Stack**: Python (Flask) Backend + Vanilla JS Frontend.
*   **AI Engine**: Powered by **Google Gemini LLM** for deep context understanding and dynamic conversation.
*   **Voice**: Integrated Web Speech API for low-latency Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech.

It's designed to help job seekers practice in a stress-free, realistic environment before the real deal.
